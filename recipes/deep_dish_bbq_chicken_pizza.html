                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the dough: If making the pizza dough from scratch, follow a recipe or use pre-made dough. Let the dough rise and come to room temperature according to the instructions. </li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature, typically around 425°F (220°C), or as specified in your recipe. </li>
                    <li>Prepare the pizza pan: Grease a deep-dish pizza pan with oil or cooking spray to prevent sticking. Make sure the pan is well coated, including the sides.</li>
                    <li>Shape the dough: Take the pizza dough and press or stretch it to cover the bottom and sides of the greased pizza pan. Ensure an even thickness throughout. Let it rest for a few minutes to relax the gluten.</li>
                    <li>Spread the barbecue sauce: Take a generous amount of barbecue sauce and spread it evenly over the dough, covering the entire surface.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken/beef and toppings: Place the cooked and sliced or shredded chicken evenly over the barbecue sauce layer. Add any additional toppings like sliced onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, or pineapple according to your preference.</li>
                    <li>Cheese it up: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese over the toppings, covering them entirely. Use a combination of cheeses like mozzarella, cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a cheese blend for added flavor and texture.</li>
                    <li>Bake the pizza: Place the pizza pan in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time, usually around 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                    <li>Garnish and serve: Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly. Sprinkle fresh chopped cilantro or parsley on top for a burst of freshness. Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
